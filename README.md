# simple-downloader

In many big organizations and enterprise, the access to internet resources could be very restricted and only specific hosts can download resources from repositories on the internet.
To workaround the restrictions, this project would create a simple web-based downloader which is supposed to be running on a whitelisted host with more access to internet resources.
Users can login the simple downloader and have the downloader download some internet resources on behalf.
